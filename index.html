<p>Here is the super awesome list of reasons to use Sequelocity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplifies your code by eliminating repetitive boilerplate code</li>
<li>Offers a very readable and concise fluent ( method chaining ) syntax</li>
<li>Automatically handles all database connection opening, closing, and disposing of unneeded resources</li>
<li>Can map results back to strongly typed objects, dynamic objects, DataSets or DataTables</li>
<li>Can generate SQL insert statements given a strongly typed object, anonymous object, or dynamic object</li>
<li>Is backed by over 400 tests</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>One of the design goals of Sequelocity is provide a very simple fluent ( method chaining ) programming interface enabling much more concise and readable code than standard ADO.NET code is typically written.</p>

<p>Common Sequelocity code would be implemented like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-csharp"><pre><span class="pl-k">using</span> SequelocityDotNet;

<span class="pl-s">public</span> <span class="pl-s">static</span> SuperHero GetSuperHero( <span class="pl-st">string</span> superHeroName )
{
    <span class="pl-s">const</span> <span class="pl-st">string</span> sqlQuery = @<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
<span class="pl-s1">SELECT  TOP 1 *</span>
<span class="pl-s1">FROM    SuperHero</span>
<span class="pl-s1">WHERE   SuperHeroName = @SuperHeroName</span>
<span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;

    <span class="pl-k">var</span> superHero = Sequelocity.GetDatabaseCommand()
        .SetCommandText( sqlQuery )
        .AddParameter( <span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>@SuperHeroName<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, superHeroName, DbType.AnsiString )
        .ExecuteToList&lt;SuperHero&gt;()
        .FirstOrDefault();

    <span class="pl-k">return</span> superHero;
}</pre></div>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/wiki/Examples">Examples</a> wiki page or explore the project unit tests for many more examples.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-databasecommand" class="anchor" href="#the-databasecommand" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The DatabaseCommand</h3>

<p>Sequelocity introduces the DatabaseCommand as a thin layer of abstraction upon the native Microsoft .NET Framework <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Data.Common.DbCommand(v=vs.110).aspx">System.Data.Common.DbCommand</a> in order to introduce several beneficial features such as automatic connection handling, event handlers, and extension points.</p>

<h5>
<a id="automatic-connection-handling" class="anchor" href="#automatic-connection-handling" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic Connection Handling</h5>

<p>When utilizing the DatabaseCommand object, all of its execute methods automatically open and close the underlying database connection and dispose of the underlying ADO.NET DbCommand which removes the need for writing the common and repetitive boilerplate code of opening connections, closing connections, and C# using statements.</p>

<p>Through experience, we've found that the majority of database code simply needs to issue a single query and return the results so we've optimized the library to handle this most common scenario with ease by handling all connection-related concerns and disposing of no longer needed resources.</p>

<p>Of course if you are in need to keep a connection open after issuing a command, there are optional parameters that allow you to specify that giving you complete control of the connection handling.</p>

<h5>
<a id="event-handlers-aka-interception-points-aka-hooks" class="anchor" href="#event-handlers-aka-interception-points-aka-hooks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Event Handlers aka Interception Points aka Hooks</h5>

<p>When utilizing the DatabaseCommand object, all of its execute methods will automatically invoke / call all registered event handlers before calling the database ( Pre-Invoke ), after the database has been called and the results returned ( Post-Invoke ), and upon any unhandled exceptions.</p>

<p>It is very easy to register to one of these events in order to facilitate injecting your own behavior, to assist in debugging, or to enable logging queries, results, or exceptions.</p>

<h5>
<a id="extension-points" class="anchor" href="#extension-points" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extension Points</h5>

<p>If you take a look at the code base for Sequelocity, you will find that almost all of the behavior for the DatabaseCommand object is actually implemented as extension methods. What this means is that new behavior can be easily added by you or your team by simply implementing your own extension methods.</p>

<p>This architectural decision was very much intentional and demonstrates that Sequelocity is not really a framework but a utility and helper library for helping you connect and interact with your ADO.NET supported database of choice. The DatabaseCommand object is just a very simple light-weight wrapper around the .NET framework provided DbCommand in order to enable additional functionality and features.</p>

<p><em>You can visit the <a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/wiki/DatabaseCommand-Overview">DatabaseCommand Overview</a> wiki page for a more detail on it and examples of working with the DatabaseCommand.</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="unit-tests-and-integration-tests" class="anchor" href="#unit-tests-and-integration-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit Tests and Integration Tests</h3>

<p>Sequelocity is backed by a large test suite comprising over 400 unit and integration tests. These tests serve as a contract specifying the behavior we expect out of each and every method which leads to a lot of tests which appear to be near duplicates of other tests and indeed many of the DatabaseCommand tests are 95% the same code as their DbCommand test counterparts but this is intentional and again is meant to serve as validation of expected method behavior. We hope that such a large test suite will give you confidence and 'the warm and fuzzies' knowing that many, many hours were put into writing tests that cover every inch of code in the Sequelocity code base and it is our hope that this will ensure a low number of bugs, increased quality, and the ability to add new features without breaking existing functionality.</p>

<h5>
<a id="unit-test-vs-integration-test" class="anchor" href="#unit-test-vs-integration-test" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit Test vs Integration Test</h5>

<ul>
<li>We define unit tests as code that attempts to isolate a single unit, which we typically consider a method, and confirm its expected behavior attempting to not exercise any external resources. </li>
<li>We define an integration test as basically the same thing as a unit test except the goal is to also exercise the external resources such as running the method against an actual SQLite or Sql Server database. *Note that 'integration test' usually means more than this meaning but for this project this simplified meaning helps to differentiate the two types of testing being performed.</li>
</ul>

<h5>
<a id="test-projects-breakdown" class="anchor" href="#test-projects-breakdown" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Projects Breakdown:</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/tree/master/src/SequelocityDotNet">SequelocityDotNet</a> - This is the main project and contains only a single file named SequelocityDotNet.cs.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/tree/master/src/SequelocityDotNet.Tests">SequelocityDotNet.Tests</a> - These are unit tests as defined above, are the most abundant, and are lightning fast to run.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/tree/master/src/SequelocityDotNet.Tests.SQLite">SequelocityDotNet.Tests.SQLite</a> - These are integration tests against an in-memory SQLite database and are lightning fast to run.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/AmbitEnergyLabs/Sequelocity.NET/tree/master/src/SequelocityDotNet.Tests.SqlServer">SequelocityDotNet.Tests.SqlServer</a> - These are integration tests against a Sql Server database kindly provided by AppHarbor and take about 8 seconds to run depending on your connection speed. *Note that we do not share the ConnectionString to our test Sql Server for obvious reasons so the tests won't be immediately runnable but you can simply replace the ConnectionString with your own and the tests should run just fine as all tests are self contained and will conveniently create any database objects that they need to satisfy the test.</li>
</ul>
